Of all the many skills vital to career success that are regrettably never thoroughly taught or discussed, I would probably place receiving feedback at the top. I'd like to dedicate this post to all the students out there who are signing up for portfolio reviews, emailing recruiters, sharing their reels, and browsing sites like this one.

I've got some advice for you.

## Receiving feedback, rule #1: Extreme and Total Silence

This is the most difficult item of all the ones I have to share, and also the most important; _the very last thing you want to do during a review is to excuse your work_. It is harrowing, it is painful, but you must endure. When your reviewer is browsing through your portfolio or watching your reel, _you must remain quiet_. Not in the sense that you don't answer questions or make small-talk, but your mind and body will urge you to come up with excuses for why your work looks the way it does. If any variation of the following thoughts pop into your head:

* _"This is an old piece"_
* _"This was made under a very strict deadline"_
* _"I'm not really happy with how this turned out"_

Then clench your fist and bite your tongue! Once your reviewer has had a thorough look at your work, you can start having a conversation. At this time it's no problem to share details or thoughts, and you should of course answer candidly to any questions the reviewer might have.

So why is this so important?

* Excusing your work will invariably come across as insecure
* It's better to let others form their opinion about your work before you share your own
* Reviewing work on it's own merits requires it to have as little context as possible

## Receiving feedback, rule #2: Maintaining Objectivity To Your Work

Being able to grow artistically requires you to have a healthy relationship to your own work, and that involves having a certain amount of distance to it. Others will view your work with little context or sentiment, and being able to do the same will help you immensely. So while it's important to realize the weaknesses in your work, I'd say that it's equally important to recognize its strengths. A single effect can be broken down in any number of ways, and the more perspectives you can have, the better.

Another benefit of this mindset is that criticisms towards your work becomes a lot less personal. 

## Bonus - Asking for feedback: "Any thoughts?"

Not a week goes by without someone posting a recent creation of theirs with the comment _"any thoughts?"_ or _"what could be improved?"_. I don't want to deride people for asking for feedback, something which is incredibly important, but if you want your feedback to be qualitative and actionable, then so must your questions be. Start by figuring out some of the following

* _What am I unhappy with?_
* _What compromises were I forced to make?_
* _What can I do to bring it closer to this other thing?_

Asking questions with these things in mind will make it much, much easier for others to approach your work and give constructive feedback.
