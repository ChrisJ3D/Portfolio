Of all the many skills vital to career success that are regrettably never thoroughly taught or discussed, I would probably place receiving feedback at the top. I'd like to dedicate this post to all the students out there who are signing up for portfolio reviews, emailing recruiters, sharing their reels, and browsing sites like this one.

I've got some advice for you.

## Receiving feedback, rule #1: Extreme and Total Silence

This is the most difficult item of all the ones I have to share, and also the most important; _the very last thing you want to do during a review is to excuse your work_. It is harrowing, it is painful, but you must endure. When your reviewer is browsing through your portfolio or watching your reel, _you must remain quiet_. Not in the sense that you don't answer questions or make small-talk, but your mind and body will urge you to come up with excuses for why your work looks the way it does. If any variation of the following thoughts pop into your head:

* _"This is an old piece"_
* _"This was made under a very strict deadline"_
* _"I'm not really happy with how this turned out"_

Then clench your fist and bite your tongue! Once your reviewer has had a thorough look at your work, you can start having a conversation. At this time it's no problem to share details or thoughts, and you should of course answer candidly to any questions the reviewer might have.

So why is this so important?

* Excusing your work will invariably come across as insecure
* It's better to let others form their opinion about your work before you share your own
* Reviewing work on it's own merits requires it to have as little context as possible
