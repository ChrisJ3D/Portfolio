# Mentorships

I've needed _a lot_ of help getting to where I am today, and I believe the best way to show appreciation for that help is to pay it forward. That's why I want to help you succeed, no matter if you've barely gotten started or if you've been doing this since forever.

I'm happy to provide portfolio reviews, advice, long-term mentoring, or answer any questions you might have about working with digital art in the film or games industry. And if I can't help you, there's a good chance I'll be able to get you connected with someone who can. 

Don't hesitate to get in touch in a manner of your choosing (links at the bottom of the page) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
