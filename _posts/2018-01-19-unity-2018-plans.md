Maybe not a fully fleshed out roadmap, but they have a lot of interesting tidbits.

> In 2018.1 we have included 2 rendering pipelines for users. Not only are these usable right out of the box, they can serve as reference for developers building their own render pipelines.
> * Lightweight Rendering Pipeline – A pipeline designed for mobiles and platforms without compute shader capability.
> * High Definition Rendering Pipeline – A modern high fidelity renderer for developing games for platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11 and above).

I'm not a graphics programmer but the scriptable rendering pipeline seems to alleviate a lot of the grievances low-end programmers have had.

> Authoring shaders in Unity has traditionally been the realm of people with some programming ability. In 2018 we are changing this!

>Shader Graph enables you to build your shaders visually. Instead of hand writing code, you create and connect nodes in a graph network. The graph framework gives instant feedback on the changes, and it’s simple enough that new users can become involved in shader creation.

The most obvious thing that I never thought would happen in Unity.
