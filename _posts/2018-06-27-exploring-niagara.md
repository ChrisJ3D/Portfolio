## Exploring Niagara

It admittedly feels strange to finally be poking around Niagara. You'll easily find countless forum posts for the past 5 years from users saying _"it'll be fixed once Niagara comes out"_ whenever somebody tries to dicuss just about anything relating to Cascade. Epic has been silent and conservative on the matter, simply stating that the project is meant to replace Cascade and will be released _sometime_, making next to no promises beyond that. But that hasn't stopped the user base from skyrocketing the promise of Niagara, more or less making it the end-all-be-all tool for creating amazing effects. And now it's here. 

Does it fix everything? Does it reinvent the realtime VFX workflow? _Creativity Unleashed?_ In this post I'll detail some of my thoughts on this beast of a feature, and see whether is it lives up its lofty expectations.
