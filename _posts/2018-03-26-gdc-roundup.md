## [Epic Releases Paragon Assets](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/epic-games-releases-12-million-worth-of-paragon-assets-for-free)

Right in line with Epic's philosophy, which is admirable. Excellent resource, especially for students looking to deconstruct the work of others.

## [Raytracing added to DirectX](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/directx/2018/03/19/announcing-microsoft-directx-raytracing/)

Looks exciting! I can definitely see this being ideal in arch-viz types of projects.

The cynic in me, however, is wary of the proprietary nature of this technology. We see plenty of companies advertise tech as "open" and "collaborative", but no company invests this amount of time and resources out of the goodness of their hearts -- they will be looking to gain a competitive advantage from this.

## [Unity 2018.1 gets release date](http://www.cgchannel.com/2018/03/unity-technologies-reveals-unity-2018-product-roadmap/)
